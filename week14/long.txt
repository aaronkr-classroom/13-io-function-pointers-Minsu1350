 Well, you see... I'm buying this hotel and setting some new rules about the pool area. Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread.

 The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them.

 Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire. Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea.

 I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men Iike this but I will not become an executioner.
